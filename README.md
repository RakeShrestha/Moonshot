# Moonshot: Apollo Missions & Astronauts App

Moonshot is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to explore and learn about the NASA Apollo space program.

The project emphasizes key SwiftUI components such as `ScrollView`, `NavigationLink`, `Codable`, and custom layouts to create a beautiful, interactive, and user-friendly app.

## Key Features
- **Navigation Stack**: Tap on mission or astronaut names to navigate between views using `NavigationLink`.
- **Dynamic Scrolling**: Use `ScrollView` for a smooth, scrolling experience with large sets of content.
- **Image Handling**: Automatically resize images to fit available space while maintaining their aspect ratio.
- **Hierarchical Data**: Work with JSON data representing Apollo missions and astronauts, decoded into Swift data models.

## Topics Covered

This project covers the following key SwiftUI concepts:

1. **Resizing Images to Fit Available Space**: Learn how to handle images in various container sizes.
2. **Using ScrollView for Scrolling Data**: Work with `ScrollView` to display dynamic and large datasets.
3. **Pushing Views Using NavigationLink**: Implement navigation between views when an item is selected.
4. **Working with Hierarchical Codable Data**: Learn how to decode and handle complex nested data structures.
5. **Creating Custom Layouts**: Understand how to layout views in grids and flexible formats with SwiftUI.
